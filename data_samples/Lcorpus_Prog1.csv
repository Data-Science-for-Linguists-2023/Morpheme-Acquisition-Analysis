51,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_KHM,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,8,12.0,so the story starts off with the main character wearing a top hat and a coat walking down an alley and some construction workers are throwing bricks and like trash from the buildings so the character dodges some but suddenly gets hit and very angry so he lights a cigarette to calm down probably while he’s lighting a cigarette he sees a baby lying behind a trashcan and decides to pick it up hhh so then a woman with a stroller comes by and he assumes that it's hi= her baby so he goes to the st= stroller and lays it in hhh but the woman the woman gets angry and I think she hits him but at least he's she's screaming at him so he takes the baby out and tries to / lay it back to the trashcan because it's not him but a policeman sees him and he decides to pick it up again and go away because he don't want to get in trouble with the policeman so then he tries to give it to a stranger pretending he has to lace his shoes so he's giving it to the stranger the stranger is holding the baby and he pretends to lace his shoes then he runs away from the stranger and he’s hiding the stranger then tries the same trick as the uh protagonist or the top hat man and is laying the baby in the same cart from the same woman from before hhh so and then the protagonist comes from his hiding spot down the alley no down the street from the alley where the woman with the now again wrong baby is standing with the stroller and then she notices him ‘n’ is assuming that he put the baby inside again so he hits him and is calling the policeman from before and then the protagonist has to pick up the g= the baby again from the stroller and is thinking about another way to get rid of it so he goes to some kind of / alley or street and is sitting down next to a sewer and is trying to or is at least thinking about throwing the baby in the sewer so he's opening the canal closure and thinks about it for a second but then decides to not do it and is holding the baby in his arms while it's doing that he is finding i= a little note saying please take care of this orphan or please love it and that's basically the last scene and he decides to keep it I guess

76,DE_SP_C1_19_11_14_LM,C1 (lower advanced),19,German,8,11.0,okay uh the scene of Charlie Chaplin is about a man who obviously is Charlie Chaplin and he finds a baby and he tries everything to get rid of this baby and yeah in the end he keeps the baby so uh first in the scene we see how Charlie Chaplin goes into an alley where he finds a baby that uh is placed uh next to a bin and uh he immediately takes the baby into his arms and uh when he sees a woman dri= uh going by with uh / when he sees a woman going by he uh tries to uh put the baby into the pacifiered she is uh a paci= pacifier uh was it what was the word again to the uh in the to the carriage uh the kid's carriage and tries to put uh the baby inside but the woman immediately uh is outraged and gives him the baby back and then he tries= he goes back to where he found the baby and tries to put it down there again but uh an officer an police officer who uh sees him notice that he's uh putting the baby back uh  / but yeah notice him and then Charlie Chaplin sees them and uh takes the baby with him and uh then when he goes other side of the alley he sees an old man with a walking stick and and gives him the baby and runs uh runs away and the old man then sees again the same woman with a carriage baby carriage and uh gives her the baby and uh the woman doesn't really notice the old man so when Charlie Chaplin goes by she thinks that it was him and gives him the baby back then uh Charlie Chaplin he uh yeah and th= then th= the officer also comes and uh Charlie Chaplin has baby and then uh he goes away again and sits down on the uh on the pavement and he then uh / he then looks kinda like he wants to give up and then he then he notices a paper a folded paper in the uh in the baby uh in the hhh uh in the blanket the baby is wrapped in and takes out the paper ‘n’ reads that ‘n’ there's a sentence there that says that the person who finds a baby should uh take care and give love to this orphan child and uh then he decides to keep the baby and then he goes goes away again with the baby
77,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_KH,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,8,12.0,okay uh so Charles Chaplin is a middle-aged man wearing something like an old-fashioned uh suit or smoking and a melon hat and he's just about to uh glim his cigarette uh when he finds a baby on the streets uh ‘n’ then he sees a woman who is sure of that she might be the mother of the child uh but when he uh asks her or brings a child to her uh he realizes that she isn't obvious she's obviously not the mother and she kind of freaks out ‘n’ then he's not sure what to do so he uh lays the child back on the street and uh hhh then a police officer sees him and uh tells him that he can't uh let this child alone on the street so uh he takes the child again and brings it to an uh another man and then he pretends like uh his shoe’s open uh and in this second he runs away so uh the man uh is or the other man is alone with a child uh hhh and then the man sees the same woman as Charles Chaplin did uh so uh he brings the child to this woman uh and when the woman then sees Charles Chaplin again she kind of freaks out again hhh and so he uh yeah takes the child with him and sits down on the pavement and when he is uh looking at the child he founds a letter in the uh duvet of the child uh and then he sees that this child is an orphan child and he or someone is looking for someone who can take care of the child and love it
78,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_NS,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,7,12.0,hhh in the beginning we see Charlie Chaplin uh walking around in an what appears to be an industrial area uh when he wants to light up a cigarette uh he finds a baby lying on the floor uh / he then uh sees a woman in the background running around with a baby wagon he then assumes that the baby belongs to the uh to the to the woman with the baby wagon and uh just drops it off uh the baby actually does not  belong to the woman and uh yeah she forces uh the baby more or less out of the bab= baby wagon onto Charlie Chaplin once more uh yeah he then wants to drop the kid off to on the ground but uh yeah a nearby police officer stops him from doing that and uh yeah Chaplin walks around with the with the kid yeah not knowing what to do with it uh when he sees another man he then pretends that he has something on his shoe and that he wants to clean it and therefore the man has to take care of the child for for a second uh yeah but when he hands uh the the child to the man he just runs away hhh uh yeah in the next sequence we see the man uh dropping the the child off uh into the baby wagon of the of the women that we have seen in the in the first sequence as well uh to just to get rid of it uh yeah meanwhile uh Chaplin walks by once more on the street uh and yeah the woman uh assumes that Chaplin uh it was Chaplin who dropped off the the baby once more into the baby wagon and then uh yeah more or less beats him up uh forces the baby onto him once more uh yeah then uh Charlie Chaplin uh walks around uh yeah looking a bit cluelessly uh sits down on the ground and uh he then finds finds a note uh that that came with the with the baby and the note says uh please take care and love this orphan child hhh yeah uh the short film ends uh with Charlie Chaplin uh standing up still holding the the baby but looking a bit more happy so it looks like he he now wants to take care of the baby
79,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_SK,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,8,12.0,uh in the short video you can see a man who finds a baby and then he tries to get rid of the baby because he doesn't want to have it and he sees uh a a mother walking around with another baby and he thinks that the baby that he found belongs to the other woman so uh he tries to give it to her but she doesn't want to have it so it's not her baby obviously and then uh hhh he tries to get rid of it in another way he just I think he just laid the baby on the ground but then another man came by and saw how he just put it on the ground and then he uh took the baby again and ran away with it and in the end he couldn't get rid of the baby because of many different reasons and then he saw a note in the baby's uh I don't know how it's called I think it's like a blanket and there he found a note which says uh I think take care of the orphan child so it means that the baby is an orphan and because of that uh the man decides to keep it to keep the baby and then he takes the baby home
80,DE_SP_C1_21_11_14_JB,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,9,11.0,uh a man walks along a street where thra= uh trash gets thrown out of the window and he gets hit by some trash after that he lights the rest of a cigar and looks around ‘n’ sees a baby and he thinks somebody lost this baby a mother with a wagon for children uh walks by and he runs to her saying you dropped something and tries to hand the baby to her but it isn't hers so he has to walk along with the baby and hhh tries to put it back to the trash cans but he's stopped by a policeman and is taking up the baby walking along the streets again where he mee= meets another old man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes and while the old man holds the baby he's running away to hide and get lost of the baby / but unfortunately uh the old man finds the same mother again with the wagon with the other child in it and the old man / puts the baby in the wagon and after that uh the / actor walks by and the mother sees him and / thinks he wanted to put the baby again in her child wagon but uh and he for= she forces him to take it back in cooperation with the policeman while he's walking along the street again after that with the baby he sits down on the sidewalk and thinks about dropping the baby in the sewer but uh he / stops this idea and finds a letter in the baby's cushion and it says please love and care for this orphan child
81,DE_SP_C1_21_12_13_LJ,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,9,12.0,One day little Henry and his Bob dog uh catched a frog in the park uh at home he put this frog in a glass and watched this frog with his dog he was very happy that he found this frog in the park because uh he was very interested in watching animals uh / xxx and uh live their lives uh at night he went to sleep and uh the frog took this chance and left this glass because he didn't like being uh kepted in a glass / uhm Henry didn't recognize that at all he was asleep had a nice dream and uh wake up the next morning and had to see that the frog was gone and he was very sad because he really liked the frog he had called him Tom uh so he and his dog Bob went to the forests to hhh to look where the frog had gone / they / searched him everywhere they climbed trees and called his name but they didn't find the frog / suddenly an elk came out of nowhere and uhm  / pushed Henry and his Bob uh dog Bob uh into the lake / Henry w= was very frightened of the elk and he thought he had to die because he couldn't swim / uh but fortunately there was a a broken tree lying on the lake in the lake so uhm he could rescue him and his dog Bob / And when they got out of the lake they found hhh the frog and uh noticed that he had gone home to his family to his frog wife and his six little children and Henry realized that the frog Tom was now where he belonged with his family.
82,DE_SP_C1_23_10_13_SP,C1 (lower advanced),23,German,9,10.0,One day a little boy and its dog caught a frog in a bottle uhm / the frog escaped during the night uh / and on in the next morning uh the little boy and its dog uh saw that the frog wasn't in the bottle anymore so the both of them were searching for it uh near the forest they climbed trees and boulders and uh were looking for the little frog and while being on a boulder uh an animal uh / caught the little boy hhh between its horns and uh / was kind of pushing them uh / from a hill and the little boy and its dog uh were falling into a lake uh where they try to escape the water by climbing on / uh on s= on some wood / being near the lake and uh there they found a family of frogs and uh since I guess they thought that these frogs or one of these frogs uh was the frog they caught earlier uh they were happy to see him being alive and waved them good-by and left.
83,DE_SP_C1_23_14_14_KD,C1 (lower advanced),23,German,9,14.0,okay so uh the video starts with Charles Chaplin walking along a run-down area where uh bricks apparently uh fall off the roof and uh as he walks along uh some bricks fall onto him and uh the cigar he's smoking uh falled out of his mouth so he decides to take a break and uh uh light uh wants to light his smoke again uh as he uh does it he sees a baby uh on the floor to his left and uh is a bit clueless why it's lying on the floor so he picks it up and uh then sees uh a mother with a= her baby walking uh along and thinks that the baby might be hers so he wants to give it to her but uh the baby apparently isn't hers and she's getting angry that the Charle Chaplin wants to give her the baby so uh he takes it back and uh doesn't know what to do with it so uh he plans to take it back where he found it uh and wants to put it on the floor but then an officer walks along and uh sees Chaplin doing that so he uh he thinks that Charles Chaplin wants to drop off the baby and uh Chaplin picks the baby up and walks away instead of getting into trouble so uh as he walks along he doesn't really know what to do so he tries to be uh trick an man he walks beside and uh thi= uh im= uh thinks he can trick him through uh pretending that he has something on his shoe and wants to uh wipe it off or something gives the baby to the older man and then runs away so the older man has now the baby and uh he doesn't know what to do and he sees the mother uh with her baby Charles has seen before uh and wants to give her the baby as well so uh he uh gives it to him but uh and walks away and at the same time Chaplin walks uh just carries on walking basically and uh then comes across the mom with her baby again the mom just noticed then that the she has the baby she's seen before uh and thinks Chaplin has put the baby in her carriage it again so uh she tells him he needs to pick up the baby and uh keeps on moving that the baby isn't hers and uh then the officer from before is there as well and uh tells Chaplin he needs to take the baby so Chaplin uh / grabs the baby and uh just walks away with it he’s a bit clueless what to do and uh then finds a letter in the rags of the baby and uh reads it where it says that the baby is an orphan and uh the person who found it or that uh they hope that he finds a new uh parent basically who c= loves him and uh Chaplin decides to keep the baby and walks away with it
84,DE_SP_C1_24_16.5_14_SB,C1 (lower advanced),24,German,8,16.5,okay so in the video uh Chaplin walks down a street I think then he sees a baby and he he contemplates what who the baby belongs to and who uh whose baby it is then he picks it up and / I think then he sees a stroller and then he puts the baby into the stroller uh of a of a woman and / the woman sees this and obviously it's not her baby so she tells him I think she I mean obviously it's it's uh a lot of voice but I think she tells him to to get it out again so he does and then he puts it back where he found the baby uh in that minute a policeman walks by ‘n’ sees it so Chaplin picks up the baby again ‘n’ then he walks to a different street trying to to find someone to get the baby to then he sees a man who walks on a cane and he gives the baby to him and kind of acting like he's just tying his shoelaces and then he runs away and hides and uh then the man with the cane who has the baby uh puts the baby into a stroller again which happens to be the same stroller of the same woman as before and then he walks away while the woman wasn't there at the second ‘n’ then Chaplin walks by while the woman gets out ‘n’ sees the baby in there again ‘n’ then he hhh he sh= she chases after Chaplin ‘n’ kind of beats him down and and tells him to to get the baby out again which he uh kind of doesn't ‘n’ then the policeman walks by again and she tells the policeman about this isn't this isn't that this isn’t her baby and then he takes it out again ‘n’ ‘n’ ‘n’ leaves the the scene uh hhh what happens next uh I think / if I remember correctly he / sits down with the baby ‘n’ then he finds a letter uh while he he kind of looks at the baby ‘n’ the letter says that this is an orphan child ‘n’ that the letter uh whoever wrote it hopes that someone will care ‘n’ love for the love the child ‘n’ then it looks like he kind of uh / thinks about what to do with it ‘n’ then kind of starts liking it ‘n’ he walks up with the baby ‘n’ then the video ends
85,DE_SP_C1_20_11_14_ALB,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,9,11.0,uh okay so in the video we can see a man who seems to be a little clumsy and I do believe he's Mr. Chaplin uh he's walking along a street and he nearly gets it with things from I don't know like constru= construction site uh so then he likes to smoke he smokes two or three cigarettes uh and when he puts off his cigarette he actually sees a little baby on the street and he picks it up and it's screaming and he doesn't really know what to do with it and he sees an old lady and he tries to put it with her uh but she doesn't like it doesn't seem to be really her child so she screams at him and he takes back the baby when he then tries to put it back down on the floor where he found the baby he gets caught by a police officer and so he takes it back up uh I believe next he's trying to give it to an old man uh but the old man then also tries to give it to the lady and he then runs away so when Mr. Chaplin walks by the lady the lady sees him and thinks well he wanted to give her the child again so she yells at him and the police xxx officer comes and he's also yelling at them so they're having a discussion so at the end Mr. Chaplin takes the baby and they sit down uh on the concrete of the street and he tries well he's starting to play with the baby and he finds a little letter saying that it's an orphan child and that someone whoever finds it please should take care of the baby and then he walks up with the baby
86,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_MDD,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,9,12.0,so in the video uh the kid from Charlie Chap= Chaplin a man walks down an alley and some things are dropped off a building he keeps on walking ‘n’ stops at a little corner where more things are dropped uh some of that falls on him then he lights himself a cigarette hhh using a shoe uh looking to the side he finds a a child picks it up uh then a woman walks by with her child he follows her ‘n’ puts the child he found at the corner next to the barrels uh in the carriage the woman comes out of the building where she went in before uh and is angry with him saying uh and then he says pardon you dropped something then she angrily tells him to pick up the child ‘n’ he almost takes the wrong child uh she is really angry with him after that and he takes the right child goes back to the corner where he found the little human being and puts it back in that moment a police off= police officer walks by and tells him to pick up his child he does so and walks to a different alley that's where he finds another man ‘n’ he tells him that he has to tie a shoe so the man takes a child and the man uh runs away in the next scene we see a different alley rather uh more a main street UH and the man who now has the child sees the carriage and puts the child in uh and walks away then Charlie Chaplin which I suppose is the man with the head from the beginning uh was hiding in a shed in the meantime walks by and in that moment the woman comes out of the shop and sees him follows him rather runs after him and hits him with her umbrella until he gets back to the carriage to pick up the child uh he does so but only because the policeman who we've seen before in the video uh comes by and demands that he does so then he sits down at a sidewalk uh finds a note in the children's clothes which says please take care ‘n’ love this orphan child ‘n’ then he smiles takes the baby closer to himself and walks away with the child
87,DE_SP_C1_21_12_14_FS,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,8,12.0,okay uh the short movie the kid by Charles Chaplin is about a young man who was walking through the city and found a baby in the street and he picked it up and didn't know what to do with it so he tried to return it to his owner at first that was uh his mom not his owner his mom there was a young lady he thought she could be the mom of the baby or the nanny of the baby but she wasn't and so she gave the baby back to him and he tried to put it back where he found it but a police officer interrupted him by doing so and / uh so he had to take the baby back and gave it to an old man he then saw the woman with a I think it's a carriage I don't know with the carriage and put it to the other baby she she soon found out that there was another baby in her carriage she recognized the baby and she recognized the young man again in the street so he had to take the baby back because she got hurt by a police officer and in the end he was sitting down one of the streets and thinking about what he's going to do next then he found a letter with the baby where it was written something like that this was an orphan child and somebody should adopt him and love him and so he was taking the baby ‘n’ walking out of the picture and so we could assume that he maybe take the baby in / I think that was about it
88,DE_SP_C1_21_12.5_14_MR,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,9,12.5,uh in this short video clip Charles Chaplin the baby hhh and there is Charlie Chaplin who walks yeah who walks around a small street and finds a baby lying beside some bins and so he takes the baby and when a woman walks by he thinks that the woman has forgotten her baby or has lost the baby so he walks towards her and wants to give her the baby back into her baby bug= buggy but uh yeah the woman shows that it is definitely not her baby and she gets angry so Charles Chaplin takes the baby back and uh wants to put it back to the place where he found it on the ground uh there was a policeman who stands behind him who takes him that he should take the baby back and should not put it on the ground so Charle Chaplin swiftly takes the baby and walks away uh he walks around the corner and so and he meets a man who yeah whom he wants to give the baby he pretends that the man should hold the baby uh but then he swiftly runs away the old man then gets angry and walks with the baby toward a shop where a baby buggy is standing in front of the shop uh when he arrives there he puts the baby into the baby buggy but the woman the mother of the other baby is the is the woman with the baby buggy whom he wants to hand the baby uh before which Charles Chaplin has already tried to put the baby into the buggy so the woman gets angry again and uh Charlie Chaplin walks by and meets the woman again and she gets more angry than before there is also the police officer who who walks by and sees the encounter and uh when Charle Chaplin sees him as well he takes the baby again and walks away finally he sits down and reads a letter which was yeah which was handed by the baby and uh yeah he reads the he reads the small letter which tells that uh which has the words please care and love this orphan child Charles Chaplin reads the letter and uh yeah holds the he holds the small child in his arms and then finally settles down with the baby
89,DE_SP_C1_21_13_13_LE,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,8,13.0,One day Charly was looking at a glass with his dog where he captu= captured a frog that he found in the backyard uh at night the frog got out of the glass and the next morning Charly and his dog looked at the glass and the frog was gone he and the dog looked everywhere for the frog they went into the backyard and into the forest they looked at every t= tree and under the bushes / they climbed up every little stone and mountain and yelled for the frog then suddenly a deer came and pushed Charly and the dog down the rock he fell into the water but then uh this is where he saw the frogs but in fact he didn't see just one frog but he saw the whole frog family so Charly knew that the frog was in a happy place and he waved and left the frog family.
90,DE_SP_C1_22_14_14_BG,C1 (lower advanced),22,German,8,14.0,uh in the video you can see Charles Chaplin walking down like a filthy street and where people literally throw out trash out of the balcony and he is uh not happy about the situation when he tries to lit a cigarette and while he walks he finds a little a baby near a dumping right next to the dumpster and he takes the baby and seeing a woman uh walking down the street and with the stroller with the baby in it he just assumes that the baby fell out of that stroller which causes for the person a comedic effect of this rather sad situation that a baby was left on the dumpster and uh after putting the baby in the stroller he said you dropped something and even assumes that he did something nice for the lady and then he tips his hat like and saying you're welcome and but the woman is not happy about that she uh t= tells him to take the baby and is uh rather aggressive about it and uh really desperately he decides to take the baby back to where he found it and but the police officer xxx back and without uh even arguing or without even uh trying to explain xxx he take the baby like he’s trying to uh do something right which is uh interesting because he could have told the police officer that the baby is not his or that he doesn’t know how this baby belongs to but he seems to be so frightened that he just take the baby again uh and in the moment of despair he gives the baby to a total stranger walking down the street and then uh well t= telling him that he has to uh tie his shoe after that uh the man finds the same lady with the same stroller and puts the baby in the place again and he just take off and when Charles Chaplin walks down the same street again the woman sees him and just drags him back down to the stroller and is again really aggressive and very curious about the situation and tells uh him to take the baby and uh then the police officer comes again and uh he has no other option but to take the baby again and when in the last scene when you can see that he’s sitting uh on the sidewalk and he even opens up uh hhh the underground xxx to put the baby down there but uh he decides not to do it he then you know decides uh to look at the baby and notices that there’s a little note and tucked into his clothes that says love and care for this orphan chil= orphan child and this note immediately speaks to him because he decides uh to he looks at the baby he smiles and just gives him a little hug and then he gets up and goes his own way so to say that he accepted the note and that he is going to take care of that orphan child
91,DE_SP_C1_24_15_14_LA,C1 (lower advanced),24,German,8,15.0,okay so the scene starts with Mr. Chaplin walking down the street and he walks past uh what seems to be a construction site and while he's walking he's smoking a cigarette and uh swinging his cane uh / walking his way somehow uh some sort of rubble seems to fall onto him uh of which he's uh annoyed and uh apparently his cigarette fell out uh on the ground so he takes out his box where he has uh several cigarettes which seem to be uh cigarettes he also found on the ground so uh like rests of cigarettes and he lights the new one hhh and keeps on going his way but sees a baby lying on the ground next to him uh covered or uh hhh in in a blanket hhh and uh he picks the baby up and looks around and tries to figure out uh whose baby it is and uh he sees uh a woman walking by with a uh stroller and uh goes to her and puts the baby in the stroller ‘cos he thinks uh it's her baby but she's uh she gets angry because it isn't and uh basically prompts him to take the baby back uh which he does uh he then tries to figure out what to do next and he wants to put the baby where he found it on the ground but uh as he's doing or as he wants to do that uh a policeman shows up and stops him from doing that hhh uh of which he again is uh a bit annoyed because he doesn't kn= uh know what to do with the baby so he keeps on going his way and uh sees another man walking past who also has a cane and uh he wants to trick him by uh giving him the baby to hold it so he can u hhh tie his shoes but he just uh / uh he acts like if he was going to tie his shoes but then he just starts to go away and hopes that uh the man will keep the baby and that the problem is now done for him uh the other man now uh who has the baby goes uh around and looking where to or wha= what to do with the baby and he then finds the tr= the the stroller uh standing around uh un= uh unwatched by the woman so he just puts it in the stroller and uh uh is back on his way uh Mr. Chaplin now is uh hhh a bit happier and walks uh around the streets again uh while and passes the stroller uh during which time the woman uh whose stroller is uh sees that there's the other baby again and is confused and looks around and sees Mr. Chaplin and uh hhh thinks that he put the baby in her stroller uh and he runs up to him and hits him with a with her umbrella and uh they both go to the stroller and the policeman comes and prompts uh Mr. Chaplin in the end to take the baby back uh which he does and then he again doesn't know what to do and sits on the sidewalk and thinks about uh throwing the baby in the sewers but uh then doesn't and he has a look at the baby and the blanket and finds the letter and uh or piece of paper and on it it says uh please care ‘n’ love for this orphan child I think and uh he's move= or he seems to be moved by the words and looks at the baby and uh as it seems he is uh happier and uh he accepts the baby in a sense and takes it with him and goes back on his way

100,DE_SP_C1_21_13_14_GW,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,8,13.0,okay uh in the video we can see uh Charlie Chaplin walking down uh a backstreet uh and I think he's going to smoke ‘n’ then he sees uh a baby on the floor and uh he goes to pick him or her up and then the mother comes by ‘n’ he thinks that she dropped the baby ‘n’ he puts uh the baby in uh in her carriage I think uh and then she's furious because not her baby of course and uh he takes uh the baby back and uh goes to put the baby back where he found the baby and in that moment a policeman comes by and uh of course policeman thinks he's doing some weird stuff and he takes the baby back and goes a different way uh and sees a man walking there and uh he tricks him into taking the baby ‘n’ then runs away and then by fate he uh comes across the woman from earlier and the man who had the baby uh took took him or her and also did the same thing Charlie did earlier and uh of course the woman thinks then that uh Charlie Chaplin did it and uh she beats him up with an umbrella I think and uh then the policeman from earlier comes by and uh Charlie Chaplin then takes the baby and uh goes to sit down with him or her and uh for the first time he really takes a look and finds a letter and uh I think a letter says please love and care for this orphan child and he then smiles at the baby and we see him walking away and probably doing just that what the letter says
101,DE_SP_C1_21_13_14_LW,C1 (lower advanced),21,German,8,13.0,in the video the man or a man is walking down the street and uh occasionally gets thrown garbage at and while he lits himself a cigarette or a cigar I couldn't really tell he finds a baby picks it up and looks around if somebody is there then uh finds a woman who's uh / with her baby in a buggy and I he tries to put it in there in there but uh / the woman doesn't she insists on that he will= he would take the baby with him because it's not hers obviously and then he tries to put it back where he found it but a police officer catches him and he picks it up again so he tries his= another attempt with a man walk I think he has a walking stick and uh he I think he asks him if he could uh hold the baby while he's tying his shoes so uh that the man with the walking stick is holding the baby and he runs off the man with the walking stick then puts the baby back into the buggy of the same woman that he uh accidentally walked past and uh he then goes off and the the man in the beginning who found the baby uh / walks again I think accidentally passed the woman and she comes out the store she see= she sees that there is another baby and then sees the man again runs after him and gets him back uh and when the woman calls him the police officer uh he the man gets the baby xxx again and uh to avoid any conversation or argument / oh wait there's also the end where uh he's taking the baby and walking around I think not knowing what to do then sitting on the the street curb or uh and then thinking about throwing the baby down the gutter but he isn't doing that and finds a letter and uh that I think that it's abandoned and somebody should take care of it and he just gets up and I guess keeps it
102,DE_SP_C1_22_14_14_SLK,C1 (lower advanced),22,German,8,14.0,okay Charlie Chaplin is walking down the street and other people are throwing rubbish out of the window uh onto him uh the second time anybody is doing that he's lighting up his cigarettes and then he's finding a baby lying on the street behind uh a bin uh and first he's struggling with uh thinking what he should do or thinking about what he should do uh but he decides to pick up the baby and uh he seems kind of helpless but then he wants to put the baby back into no a woman comes by with a a pram and another baby and then he's uh trying to put the baby he found into the pram but the woman comes back to the pram and uh gives out to him so uh he has to take back the baby and then he wants to put the baby back where he found it but uh while doing that uh a policeman is walking by ‘n’ kind of looking at him what are you doing there and so he has to pick up the baby again and he's walking a bit uh and he finds another man he tries to give the baby to the other man and he's kind of successful by running away and the other man finds the woman with the pram and the other baby and puts the baby in there as well but uh the woman comes out of the shop and sees the baby in there again and she's kind of mad uh that the baby is in there again and uh / Charlie Chaplin is walking by the woman and she remembers him from the first time he put the baby in there even though he didn't the second time so she gives out to him and kind of hits him with an umbrella ‘n’ then the policeman walks by again so Charlie has to uh take the baby again ‘n’ then he's sitting uh down at the edge of a sidewalk holding the baby and looking is there any message in uh whatever the baby has around uh his or herself him or herself uh and / uh he finds uh a tiny sheet which says uh please love and care for this orphan child uh so he / doesn't uh put the baby into the gully which was his first plan after sitting down uh and he decides to keep the baby
103,DE_SP_C1_22_15_14_AD,C1 (lower advanced),22,German,7,15.0,uh the video started with a man walking down the street uh which or who is Chaplin uh there were fa= bricks falling down on him but they were missed him by I think two seconds or something then he walked into a side road where uh somebody th= threw bri= bricks at him which hit him at the end and uh he uh picked up I think cigarettes or something and uh lit them up while taking off his gloves and putting them into the bin and in that moment he saw uh saw a baby uh lying down the foor floor ly= lying down on the floor with uh blankets wrapped around him he picked up the baby and uh thought about what to do with him uh when he walked down the road and saw a woman with a stroller walking by uh he tried to put or sh= smuggle the baby into the stroller and walk away but the woman saw him and uh argued with him and uh after all after that Chaplin took the baby back and tried to think about what to do with him he well he walked back to the place where he found the baby and tried to put the baby back to the ground when a police officer walked by and saw what happened that was why Chaplin had to pick the baby back up and uh tried to find another solution he uh saw a old man walking by and tried to uh or gave the baby to the old man and walked away and tried to hide somewhere so the old man doesn't find him the old man uh coincidentally walked by the stroller or the woman with a stroller and put the baby back into the stroller and walked away uh when Chaplin uh coincidentally walked also walked by the stroller again and the woman saw him and uh sh= started to hit him and argue with him and uh the Chaplin started discussing I think uh if he could giv= or I don't know what he was discussing about but he discussed with a woman when the police officer came back and uh Chaplin was forced to take the baby back and walk away and walking away he tried to find another solution what to do with the baby when he sat down on a sidewalk and uh just shortly thought about putting the baby down the drain or something and uh then after noticing that that is not the best solution he uh found a note inside of the blanket of the baby and uh on that note was written please love and care for the orphan child uh after reading that note Chaplin happily decided to keep the baby and walked away
104,DE_SP_C1_19_11_13_CG,C1 (lower advanced),19,German,7,11.0,One day uh a little boy and his dog seem to have found a frog which they kept in a jar and uh they look at it and try to play with it and as the night comes they go to bed and sleep / and the frog uh basically runs away he climbs out of the jar he is kept in and just / walks or runs away and the next morning when the kid and the dog wake up they see that the frog is not there anymore and then start looking for it / uh they walk into a forest and uh climb up trees to see if the frog is hidden in there and they also climb up hills and bigger stones and call for the frog / and uh they meet other animals of the forest for example a deer /. and uh the deer seems to be pushing the boy and the dog into uh what seems like a lake and uhm / the boy and the dog keep looking / uh they once again climb over uh things that are lying on the ground in the forest and after a while they uh found or they find a frog family and uh / I believe they uh take their their frog home and uh wave good-by to the other frogs and this seems to me like an happy end hhh.
105,DE_SP_C1_20_10_14_SB,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,11,10.0,the movie clip shown to me showed uh a black and white film with a man as a main character presumably it was Charlie Chaplin with who can be uh / who can be uh which we can see because of his iconic hat and uh walking stick and his suit and uh the clip shows how Charlie Chaplin / finds a baby when he's lighting his cigarette like standing in an alleyway and uh in the movie club it's shown how he tries to get rid of the baby in a comical way for example in the beginning he starts uh walking towards a carriage that has a baby in it and then uh tells the mother presumably the mother th= the woman standing next to the carriage that she has dropped something and he's indicating to the baby he has found uh and she / reacts in a very hhh in a very / mad way and uh starts shouting at him so then he has to take the baby back so ‘n’ then he decides decides to just put the baby back uh on the ground where he found it when a police officer comes coming by is coming by and uh sees it and presumably thinks that he is trying to get rid of his own baby so uh Charlie Chaplin has to take the baby uh in his arms again and uh in the next situation a very old man uh walking with a walking crane is shown and uh Charlie indicates that he has to uh he's holding the baby in his arms and he indicates that he has to fix his shoelaces so he gives the baby to the old man for him to hold it and uh after he gave the baby after he gives the baby to the man he runs off so the old man because he can't walk properly uh can't follow him quickly enough so that uh when he turns around a corner he sees a carriage ‘n’ he puts the baby in there to get rid of it uh and the carriage was standing or is standing in front of a shop and there's no uh adult beneath it uh besides it but in the next uh scene we can see that the woman that it's the woman that Charlie Chaplin has met before so uh when Charlie in the next scene is walking uh past the carriage the woman recognizes him and sees a baby in her carriage and uh thinks that he has dropped the baby again like uh the foreign baby into her baby's carriage and she starts shouting and screaming and hitting him hhh violently uh so the police officer that has seen Charlie Chaplin trying to get rid of the baby uh sees all this and it caused cau= caught his eye so he goes in uh to the scene to try to understand what is happening and the woman explains it so Charlie e= explains the situation to him so ‘n’ then Charlie has no other uh op= no other way out than taking the baby and the last scene is him sitting down on like uh on the street with the baby in his hand and underneath him he sees a uh / like a / street xxx a canalization uh / lid and uh he opens it and indicates to throw the baby into the canalization but then after taking a look at the baby's face he decides against it and uh he takes it into his arm / and wants to go off and then he finds a letter uh attached to the baby ‘n’ that says that the baby wants or needs to be loved
106,DE_SP_C1_20_11_13_NL,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,6,11.0,One day there was a little boy who / went out to the ponds with his best friend his dog and u apparently he found a little frog / since he very mu= he like frogs very much he / uh took the frog with him home and kept him in a jar / so before he went to bed he said good night to his frog / and went to sleep / however uh the frog / managed to escape out of the jar / and / left the house of the little boy / so when the boy  woke up in the morning / together with his dog he found the frog to be gone / he was very sad about it and started to search for him / he called out for him in the forests / but the frog was nowhere to be seen / so he searched further and further / climbed trees together with his dog who helped him / uh there he found a / big xxx climbed   that up one up and uh hold on to the branches to call up for uh the frog xxx it turned out that the branches he was holding / uh were not branches rather it were uh a a / big crown of a deer / uh who / where he was captured the deer got very scared and shook the little boy off which cost him to uh fall down together with his dog so he fell into a pond / gladly he wasn't insured / and he rested on a trunk / and when he looked over the trunk he found his frog together / with his family so it seem / uh so the boy found out that the frog had a family and this which is the reason why he returned to his uh to his forest to his home uh knowing that the boy / was very happy for his newly found friend and uh waved good by and / went home together with his dog.
107,DE_SP_C1_20_12_14_AB,C1 (lower advanced),20,German,8,12.0,uh so the video is a Charlie Chaplin movie and in the beginning there's a man walking down the street uh it looks like a back street with no other people and a lot of trash he uh eventually finds a baby next to some trash and picks it up uh then a woman with a trolley walks by and he assumes that the baby is hers uh so he wants to give it to her but she uh claims it not it's not hers and he uh should take it back so he takes it and decides to put it back where he found it but while he puts it down to the ground a police off= officer walks by and makes him take it and so he takes the baby and walks further on and then he meets a man and he tr= tricks the man to take the baby and wants to run away so now the man is stuck with the baby uh that man meets the same woman with a trolley and while she's not looking he puts the baby back in the trolley uh when the woman notices that the second baby is in her trolley the protagonist walks by and so she hits and fights the man so he would take back the baby uh ‘n’ then he's again stuck with the baby and walks on uh eventually he sits down on the edge of the street and tries to think of other ways to get rid of the baby uh but then he finds a little note on the baby which says to love and care for the orphan child and then he seems to decide to keep it for himself

111,DE_SP_C1_23_11_14_JP,C1 (lower advanced),23,German,12,11.0,so in this video Charlie Chaplin is walking down a an alley in a pretty run-down neighborhood people tho= thre= thow trash out of the windows and he gets hit by it and uh then he lights up a cigarette and he's seeing something and it's a baby in blankets on the on the uh on the ground and he at first thinks someone threw it out of the window as well he looks up but there's nothing so he uh picks up the baby and looks around if there's someone who might’ve put it there uh then a woman walks by with a buggy with another child in it and he thinks the baby he found is from her so he puts it in the buggy and uh says pardon madam you lost something and uh but yeah she gets angry because uh the baby isn't from her so uh she gets mad up him mad at him and tells him to take the baby and he takes it again so he takes over buggy uh and walks down the street with it and then he no uh at first he wants to put it back again where he found it and then a police officer walks by at this very moment and tells him that he can’t do that ‘n’ he has to pick the baby up again so he does that and walks down the street and there's a man with a walking cane and he uh asks him to hold the baby for a second so he can tie his shoes uh he pretends to do so and then runs away uh the man obviously because he's uh walking on the cane he can't run after him ‘n’ he also has the child so he uh is also very outraged and uh hhh takes the baby and walks with it and then he also finds the buggy of the woman and f= parked in front of his store the woman is uh inside so he thinks the same and uh or he has the same ideas uh Chaplin had before he puts the baby in the buggy and walks away the woman doesn't notice she just uh leaves the store after and then sees the other baby and at this very moment Chaplin who has hidden before comes by and uh / she sees it she she she sees him and uh obviously thinks that he put the baby in the buggy again and uh / the police officer is also there he comes by and she tells him and / the police officer also saw him before as I already said so uh he also thinks it's his baby and he makes him take the baby basically before that he also gets hit by the woman with her umbrella and uh then he takes the baby and he sits on the uh on the footpath and he's he doesn't know what to do at first like he opens the the drain and maybe thinks for a second to put the baby in there but of course he he wouldn't do that so uh hhh he's taking closer look at the baby ‘n’ the blankets and he f= he finds a note and the note says uh lo= please love and take care of this orphan baby and apparently after reading this note he decides to do that and takes the baby with him
112,DE_SP_C1_23_15_14_PGE,C1 (lower advanced),23,German,8,15.0,okay so uh we see a man walking through a city / and / he stumbles upon an abandoned child / he picks up the child ‘n’ tries to look for anyone responsible maybe a parent / in the area / turning around he sees a woman with a stroller with another child inside / and he thinks that maybe she would be the mother / he walks up to the mother who / goes inside of a building / ‘n’ so he puts the child inside of the stroller / before he / goes to leave / the mother comes outside / and says it is not her child and he has to take it back / so he takes the child back ‘n’ tries to put it back where he found it / but a policeman / uh sees this / so he picks it back up / and walks away / the policeman is constantly following him / hhh ‘n’ then he finds an older man / and under the pretends of / uh having to tie up his shoes / he uh hands over the child hhh / and but doesn’t take it back / instead he runs away / and / that older man then tries to find someone responsible / and he finds the same stroller with the with the child inside and / but without the mother again / hhh so he puts that child inside and / then / hhh / uh / uh / I forgot the connection uh / uh ‘n’ then at uh at one point / the first man walks down the street / and / previously so uh that the mother sees that the child is inside but / uh / then he sees uh she sees the man walking down the street again ‘n’ thinks he had put it inside again / the policeman is close by so she stops the man / uh beats him up hhh and takes him back to the stroller saying / he had put it ha= had put the child back inside / then she put uh stops the policeman / says oh this man / has put this child in my stroller / but it’s not my child / they both uh / force him to take it back / hhh so he takes it back / he walks / to / close uh by street ‘n’ sits down / in the corner of the uh sidewalk / ‘n’ then he looks through the child’s clothing / inside he finds a note / that says / please love and care for this orphan child / and his attitude towards giving it away changes and he smiles and / walks away / with the child

115,DE_SP_C1_26_17.5_14_JH,C1 (lower advanced),26,German,9,17.5,Charles Chaplin as the main character of the video uh walks through a city that seems a bit des= destroyed and as he stops to light a cigarette he finds an infant uh lying in a corner and he picks it up uh trying to maybe save it and as he looks around if uh there's the mother of the child he uh finds a woman with a uh stroller and he assumes that the child belongs to her and puts it in her stroller uh hhh but the woman denies that this is her child so he takes the child back and as he wants to put it back uh in the corner where he found it an officer uh notices that and uh tells them that he cannot do that leaving a child in a street so he picks the child up again and sees a stranger uh he puts the child into the stranger's arms pretending that he has to tie his laces but uh runs away and hides from the stranger the stranger again uh runs after Charles Chaplin and finds the mother with her baby carriage again and uh hhh puts the baby back into the stroller and uh as Charles Chaplin thinks he can uh walk by the mother of uh hhh uh th= the baby uh carriage uh comes out of the store again and sees that there's the second baby in her carriage again as she sees Charles Chaplin she thinks he put the baby in the stroller again and knocks him down with her umbrella uh the officer comes by to see what the matter is hhh and uh forces Charles Chaplin to take the baby with him again uh he does so and uh seems a bit confused what to do with the baby he sits down on the sidewalk and tries to think about what to do next and then he finds a note uh in the baby's clothes saying that uh hhh to take care and to love that orphan child and uh yeah so he seems to decide that he can take the baby home by himself
116,DE_SP_C1_28_19_14_JF,C1 (lower advanced),28,German,9,19.0,okay my my my task is just to uh tell you what is going on in the short film okay uh in the short film that I just watched uh Charlie Chaplin is uh strolling down a street and uh it looks very dirty there people are throwing garbage out of the window uh hhh and uh when he's hit by some garbage that was thrown out of the window he swears I think he says awkward ass to the person that threw the garbage out of the window uh he stops tries to light a cigarette but then recognizes that in a corner near him uh next to some some garbage bins uh a baby wrapped around in some blankets uh uh a baby is lying wrapped around in some and uh then he he picks up the baby hhh and uh discovers that behind him a woman with a I think it's called a buggy in in English uh like this this baby stroller thing uh is walking behind him hhh and uh stops with this buggy and uh walks into a house he then tries to put the baby into said buggy uh and hopes she doesn't uh yeah she she doesn't see him or something uh but the problem for him is that she sees him doing so and uh makes him take the baby again and  uh then he walks / walks back to the corner where with with the baby wh= where he found the baby and uh puts it back where he found it but uh then he turns around and sees that a policeman saw him put the baby back into the corner uh so he picks up the baby again and walks around some some corner he's he's in in a different street in the next scene where an old man walks with his cane and uh he then uh yeah well he he doesn't talk but he uh shows the the old man his shoe uh in order to show that he has to tie his shoe laces uh hhh and makes makes the old man take the baby that way so the old man takes the baby from him and uh yeah holds it in his arms while Charlie Chaplin is running away and uh he's hiding near the corner that whe= where he found the baby again uh the old man hhh tries to well tries to run after Charlie Chaplin but is not as as fast as him and uh puts the baby into the stroller that uh from the from one of the first scenes hhh uh from the woman that that uh walked there with with her baby uh the at that time the woman is in the house then uh in the next scene Charlie Chaplin uh strolls along uh a street where this where this stroller stands hhh and hhh uh at at that certain moment uh the woman comes back out of the house so uh she yeah well she sees the baby she sees Charlie Chaplin and uh she thinks that Chaplin put the baby into her stroller again she then uh yeah runs after him and hits him very hard with her umbrella uh hhh and makes him take the baby again so uh he picks up the baby again hhh uh and uh walks I don't know few me= meters further and sits down at the pavement hhh uh hhh then well he holds his baby in his arms and then he recognizes that there's a letter hidden inside the blankets hhh uh on on the letter it says in the letter it says uh please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child I think uh so then uh Chaplin yeah gets to know that the child is an orphan hhh and uh in the last well that that's the last scene and he he looks at it with love in his eyes I think and uh looks very happy smiles at it and in the end he stands up and uh walks away with the baby in his arms

142,DE_SP_C2_28_17.5_14_NH,C2 (upper advanced),28,German,11,17.5,ok uh in the beginning of the video clip there’s a man uh walking down the street of some sort of uh shabby looking area or some sort of side street and uh people from from up in the houses are dropping things on him which he is not very happy about uh he then stops uh to grab another cigarette from its box and uh suddenly he notices a baby which is just lying down in the corner next to him crying and uh hhh he picks it up and / is is wondering why the baby is lying there xxx ‘n’ uh in the background uh a woman appears pushing a a pram with another baby inside and uh he probably thinks that she has lost the baby and uh wants to uh return it to her but she uh she refuses and uh doesn’t seem to be missing another child so uh and also she seems quite angry and just runs away so he ends up with the child alone again and uh he then he has an encounter with another man who is rather old ‘n’ walking with a stick with a walking stick and uh then he just he just gives him the baby uh and uh that man obviously is not happy about it either and uh is uh / I don’t know where he goes next xxx I think I think to the main street main road and uh oh yeah I know so the old man with the walking stick uh he finds a a pram which the lady was pushing earlier he finds a pram standing somewhere in front of a shop ‘n’ he just puts the baby inside uh then the lady comes back wondering when that baby appeared from and uh yeah then uh and our protagonist protagonist is walking by the the pram again ‘n’ then she she sees him ‘n’ then just gives him the baby back ‘n’ then and uh after that I think there is a police officer standing observing the situation but he he doesn’t seem to be interested xxx yeah so uh in the end our protagonist from the beginning uh who / ended up with the baby and is not really is is not sure what to do next so uh he decides to sit down on the pavement and uh xxx uh suddenly uh he sees uh finds a paper hidden inside the baby’s blanket and uh / it it appears that it’s an orphan child so he uh feels pity for the child and uh xxx we don’t know how the story ends but uh he will probably take care of the child

144,DE_SP_C2_19_11_14_AE,C2 (upper advanced),19,German,8,11.0,hhh ok so the clip begins with a protagonist walking along the street and almost being hit by trash being thrown out of a window / hhh twice actually and then he lights a he takes a tin box with a cigarette hhh and light the match on the shoe and when he looks down he sees a baby laying on the ground so he picks it up and looks around like he is looking for the mother and sees the trolley uh abandoned standing on the side so he places the baby inside but the owner of the trolley probably also a mother uh sees him and since it isn’t her baby he has to take it with him again hhh so he leaves the scenery and then sees another man walking along the street so he talks to him and pretends he has to tie his shoe lace and asks him to hold the baby which he does so the protagonist bends down and then runs away leaving the other man with the baby hhh who is then the owner of the little child and hhh then he leaves the scenery again and places the baby in the same trolley we se= saw before hhh and leaves and the mother of the trolley of the other child uh then exits a building just as the protagonist from the beginning passes the trolley and her and she sees the baby so she obviously assumes he placed it there again just like he did before so she runs after him hits him with an umbrella and drags him back to the / hhh the trolley / hands him the baby again and then the policeman becomes involved he takes it without any protest and leaves once more walks along the street and drops his uh walking stick and sits down briefly considers dropping the child in the gutter which he doesn’t and closes the gutter again and then finds the little letter hidden in the clothes of the baby which reads please love ‘n’ care for the orphan child so he looks at the baby for a moment and then takes him with her as he leaves again and that where it ends
145,DE_SP_C2_20_10_13_MC,C2 (upper advanced),20,German,10,10.0,One day there was a little boy playing with his dog / he had a little frog in a glass and in the night whilst he was asleep the the dog opened the glass and the frog disappeared / he just ran away out of the room / the next morning the boy realized that the frog was gone and went outside into the forest with his dog to see if he can find him / there he looks into every bush behind every tree and behind every rock / he stood up on some rocks and shouted looking for the frog / suddenly a deer came from behind and bumped him into a lake / he fell into the lake with his head first / and there he suddenly also found the frog again he was swimming in / in the lake / the dog / the boy was very happy that he ha= that he has found the frog again and happily went home together with his dog and the frog.
146,DE_SP_C2_20_11_14_HK,C2 (upper advanced),20,German,9,11.0,uh so the video starts with uh a well-dressed man walking through a lane and then he stops to light a cigarette and uh he hears ‘n’ sees a baby next to lying on the ground next to uh some trash cans and uh he picks up the baby and looks around uh to look whether there is a person who the baby belongs to uh but first he doesn’t see anyone and then uh the woman walks by with a baby carrier with a baby in it and he thinks maybe the baby belongs to her and uh so when she’s not looking he puts the baby in her baby carrier uh but then she notices and uh is angry at him uh angry with him and uh gets the baby back to him uh and so he doesn’t know what to do with the baby and uh puts it back to the uh back back next to the trash cans on the ground but a police officer notices and uh tells him to pick the baby up again because he thinks or probably thinks that the man just tried to get rid of the baby his baby uh / and so the man put takes takes it back and uh / goes on and uh he walks by uh another man uh and tries to trick him into taking the baby and runs away uh hhh then the second man uh hhh doesn’t want the baby either and puts it into a baby carrier near him and that uh actually is the same carrier of that same woman woman uh hhh and she notices it again but uh the man who put the baby in the carrier is already gone uh but now the first man walks by so the woman thinks it’s his fault uh and gives the baby back again hhh and then uh the m= he walks or he sits down with the baby on a on the sidewalk and thinks how to get rid of it uh and then he looks at the baby and notices uh a note where it says uh please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child uh and he reads that and looks at the b= the child with a or he smiles at the child and uh takes him ‘n’ walks off
147,DE_SP_C2_20_12_14_MI,C2 (upper advanced),20,German,8,12.0,okay so this was a video of uh about Charlie Chaplin / it begins with the scene where Charlie uh walks through a neighborhood which seems a little rough / hhh and then suddenly there’s things dropped on top of an= of from above and they fall on him or close to him / and he’s wondering where it comes from ‘n’ he’s really annoyed by it it seems to be like that and uh / he then lights some uh cigarettes / and when walking around the corner I think uh he / discovers that there’s a child lying in the corner and he doesn’t seem to find a mother to it or anything so then he walks uh / around the corner walks a little bit and sees uh / an / a mother with a / hhh pushchair or something like that and uh he puts the baby in it / and kind of expects that it belongs to this mother because there’s another baby in it ‘n’ there’s room for a second one / so uh the mother obviously says it’s not my baby ‘n’ you can’t just drop it her= or she doesn’t say it but it looks like she says it / and / she then / uh so he then has to pick it up again and he decides that he just drops it back where he founds it / f= found it uh / but when he does that he / uh is uh / watched by a policeman / and because he doesn’t want any trouble or whatever hhh he picks it back up again / and just kind of walks away / and / then uh stumbling across an old man / and he acts like he has something stuck on his shoe / and therefore gives the baby to the old man / and / pretends like he’s cleaning his shoe but then running away really quickly ‘n’ the old man doesn’t / can’t follow / and / so when the old man doesn= know what to do with the baby he sees an / unsupervised pushchair / again with one baby the same pushchair that was there before / and put the baby in it / ‘n’ walks away / and doesn’t get caught by the mother / ‘n’ when the mother comes out and sees the second baby in it / exactly in that moment Charlie Chaplin walks by again / so she follows him ‘n’ kind of hits him with his with her umbrella / and / yeah / basically looks like she shouts at him to take this baby back ‘n’ that’s not hers / he then makes uh kind of the move to pick up the wrong baby / so the baby that’s actually the mother’s baby / and but in the end she he does pick up the baby that’s / uh the one that he’d apparently dropped / but I th= it seems like only because the policeman is standing next to them again / and yeah he then walks off / drops his / I guess you can call it the cane / uh no it’s not a cane because it’s not for a blind person but his walking stick whatever / and he then uh he drops it so he had to sit on the curve uh / curb / and / when / sitting there he has uh / kind of a drain next to him ‘n’ he looks into it / ‘n’ it looks like he uh / thinks about dropping the baby in there / but then he decides against it ‘n’ looks a little into the blankets that’s round and / uh kind of devel= / envelop the baby / and he finds a letter that says please / love and I think care for this orphan child / and he then / it seems like he has uh / kind of / doesn’t seem like he develops straightaway loving feelings but he seems to care about it more seeing as it is an orphan child and / he walks off with it ‘n’ it’s unknown to the viewer if it’s / if he put brings it to an orphanage or if he keeps it or anything but it’s / seems like an happy end
148,DE_SP_C2_20_14_14_LB,C2 (upper advanced),20,German,6,14.0,ok so the protagonist walks down an alley street and he’s hit by dust or trash that’s thrown out of the window ug he lights his cigarette ‘n’ then next to some trash bins he finds a child uh small baby wrapped in blankets and uh he picks it up and sees a woman passing by with a stroller with her own child in it and he follows the woman and puts the ch= the the child he picked up into the stroller ‘n’ uh then the woman scolds him and refuses to take the baby so uh the protagonist picks it up again and wants to put it back where he found it next to the trash bins but there’s a police officer right behind him so uh Chaplin is uh forced to take the child again uh he walks in another street and tricks another walking man uh into taking the child / uh and this man sees the stroller again parked outside of a shop the woman must have left it there uh and puts it back into the uh carriage uh but uh the moment the woman comes out of the shop Chaplin passes by so she thinks that he put it back there and follows him and beats him with her umbrella hhh ‘n’ then also the police officer appears so Chaplin was again forced to take the child so he sits down with it at the road side and finds a piece of paper attached to the infant that says uh please take care of this orphan child or something like that and uh yeah Chaplin smiles at the child ‘n’ then picks it up xxx
149,DE_SP_C2_21_13_14_MP,C2 (upper advanced),21,German,8,13.0,ok so in the video there’s a man I suppose it’s Charlie Chaplin and he walks down the street smoking a cigarette or a cigar I’m not sure and as he walks down that street he gets hit by something that’s falling out of the window or something stomping it from above which is like extin= extinguishing the cigarette then he gets out like a little metal box from his pocket and  picks another cigarette lights that one as he looks around he sees a little baby wrapped in a blanket laying on the floor next to a trash can and he picks up that baby looks around trying to figure out where it’s come from or if he could find someone that’s like the mom or the dad and in the background there’s a lady pushing a pram with another child in it so he calls out for her as he thinks maybe the baby belongs to her and as she doesn’t react he follows her and she enters into a building he just puts the baby in the pram she comes back out ‘n’ sees it ‘n’ then complains that’s not her child ‘n’ the two of them argue a bit she gets quite angry ‘n’ he gets the baby back out of the pram walks back to where he found it and then he just puts the baby next to the trash can ‘n’ wants to walks away but then there is a police officer of some sort behind him so he just picks the baby straight back up ‘n’ walks away with it then he kinda enters to another street and steps into like a puddle of mud or something like that ‘n’ there’s another man and he asks that man to hold the baby so he can clean up his shoes or his pants and as he gives the baby over to the other man he kinda pretends to clean his pants he just runs away and as the other man realizes that he follows him but he isn’t that fast because he’s got a walking stick and Charlie Chaplin then finds a a garage I think and the other man just kinda looks around for him and then sees the pram of that lady that Charlie went to ‘n’ puts the baby in ‘n’ walks away and then Charlie exits the garage ‘n’ wants to walk in the other direction but then there’s the police officer again so has to turn around walk the other way again ‘n’ then there’s as the lady that the pram belongs to that we’ve already seen before comes out of the building and realizes that the child is in her pram again he passes her and she like gets real angry he runs away she follows him hits with her umbrella and kinda drags him back to the pram which is also when the police officer comes by again and she complains that he again dropped the child into her pram snd that he should take it which he then does and walks away he kinda like takes that baby ‘n’ sits down side of the street with it and I don’t know he opens like a drainage cover it or something like that I don’t know contemplating to put the baby in there I’m not sure but then as he looks through the blankets that the baby is wrapped in he finds a letter that says please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child I think and after reading that he just picks up the baby again ‘n’ walks away I think
150,DE_SP_C2_21_9_13_MB,C2 (upper advanced),21,German,11,9.0,Uh / one day Marc and uh his best friend his dog uh had laid in the fields and they had managed to to caught uh / to catch a frog and uh they put him in a jar and were happily admiring the frog when finally it was time for them to go to sleep / uhm at night the frog managed to to climb out of the jar and escaped / then the following morning when Marc and his dog woke up uh they saw that the frog was g= was gone and uhm they were very sad about that so they went looking for him / uh they went back into the woods where th= where they found the frog and uh / they shouted for the frog frog where are you and looked everywhere uh they looked in empty trees uhm finally Marc even climbed onto a rock uh shouting for his friend the frog / and then suddenly uh a wild deer appeared uh pushing the two Marc and his dog off a cliff / uh they fell down into the water / and luckily both of them were good swimmers and soon they managed to climb out / climb out of the water / when they looked around / uhm they saw what they've been looking for they had been looking for / uh they saw their friend the frog and uh they saw that he had a family uh / he had / a wife and many kids uh and they noticed that uh the frog might be happier here with his family in the woods than in a jar they'd they had put him / so they waved good-by and went home.
151,DE_SP_C2_22_13_14_LF,C2 (upper advanced),22,German,9,13.0,uh so in the beginning you can see a man walking along an alley way uh dogging uh I don’t know something like that looks like a bricks being thrown out of a window uh and uh he finally gets hit with something and after that he decides to light a cigar and uh after that he finds a baby lying behind some trash cans uh he picks it up and uh looks around ‘n’ sees a woman uh with a pram and uh decides that it must be her baby ‘n’ puts it into her pram and she gets angry ‘n’ tells him no it’s not my baby uh and he then uh decides to just put the baby back to where he found it uh but runs into a police officer and uh then picks it back up and uh / walks around with it and uh find and comes across an old man and  tricks him into holding the baby ‘n’ then runs away uh the old man follows him but can’t find him and then the old man sees the pram outside of a shop and just puts the baby in that pram and the man from before uh comes out of his hiding place and uh walks by the pram ‘n’ the woman uh notices him ‘n’ sees that the baby is back in her pram and uh she runs after him ‘n’ beats him with her umbrella and uh basically uh wants him to take the baby back uh and he only does so when the police officer from before uh comes back and uh then he picks the baby back up and walks away and uh sits down somewhere on the pavement ‘n’ finds a letter uh that tells him that this is an orphan baby and to please love ‘n’ care for it and uh then he just holds it and that’s it
152,DE_SP_C2_22_14_14_MH,C2 (upper advanced),22,German,8,14.0,ok so in this videoclip uh Charlie Chaplin is walking down an alley uh when he gets hit by thrash that somebody seems to be throwing down from a window and this thrash seems to extinguish his cigarette so he needs to light a new cigarette and he gets a a new cigarette out of his pocket and then uh he discovers a baby laying on the floor bundled up in blankets and uh hhh he goes to see where it comes from ‘n’ he picks it up and is wondering where the baby came from ‘n’ then he sees uh a woman walking by with a baby carriage so it seems like he assumes that the baby must’ve come from her so he quickly runs up to her and puts the baby into the baby carriage uh and there’s already another baby inside of the baby carriage and uh then the woman uh comes back or sees that and she obviously seems to be uh angry about it or she it obviously isn’t her baby so she gives the baby back to Charlie hhh and she leaves and then uh Charlie doesn’t seem to know what else to do so he goes back to where he found the baby ‘n’ puts it back on the ground but then a police officer comes walking by and uh hhh so he is kind of so Charlie is kind of forced to pick the baby back up ‘n’ goes somewhere else and then uh he takes the baby ‘n’ walks around the corner where he sees an old man walking uh hhh so it seems like he asks the old man to hold the baby for a second when he tries to or pretends to tie his shoe uh hhh and then when the old man holds the baby Charlie quickly runs away ‘n’ hides in a garage uh hhh and so then the old man doesn’t really know what to do with baby so he walks around the corner and I think he sees the baby carriage or he sees a baby carriage in front of a store hhh and uh so he walks up to this baby carriage ‘n’ puts the baby inside of this baby carriage again uh and then the lady from before comes out of the store ‘n’ sees the baby but doesn’t know where it came from and meanwhile uh hhh Charlie came out of his uh hideout and sees the police officer again so he walks around the corner and is walking down the street where the old man had put the baby inside the baby carriage of the lady from before uh so the lady sees Charlie and thinks once again that he has put the baby into the baby carriage so she runs after him and drags him back ‘n’ starts to beat him with her umbrella and they start fighting or getting into an argument or discussing again uh hhh and so once again the police officer comes walking by and so when the lady uh starts to explain the situation to the police officer uh Charlie finally takes the baby ‘n’ walks away and again it seems like he doesn’t know what to do so he sits down on uh on the sidewalk and seems to uh think about what to do and  then there is a a sewer next to him and he opens the sewer and it seems like he is considering to put the baby into the sewer but then he closes it and takes another closer look at the baby and uh hhh then he seems to hurt his finger somewhere in the blankets of the baby and he finds a message between the blankets uh and the message is a piece of a paper and it says uh please take care please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child or something like that and so uh hhh that seems to change his mind and he takes a closer look at the baby and then finally starts smiling at it and t= talking to it and it seems like uh he has finally decided to uh yeah to be ok with it ‘n’ to take care of the baby so uh he takes it he stands up with the baby and walks away with it together
153,DE_SP_C2_23_12_13_NH,C2 (upper advanced),23,German,10,12.0,One day little Timmy and his dog found a frog in the woods and put him into a glass after that they went to sleep and during the night the frog escaped the next morning both woke up and were shocked when they saw that the frog was gone they went outside and l= looked for him shouting and screaming frog where are you though then they went into the woods looking everywhere behind trees behind bushes and little Timmy / uh even climbed on a little hill to look for the frog / unfortunately behind the hill there was a deer and the deer spiked hhh Timmy onto his  wounds and threw him off the hill together with the littlle dog both Timmy and the dog fell into a stream or a little sea uh fortunately both could be saved by means of a piece of wood in the water after they climbed over the little piece of wood they saw the frog and his family safely secured near the sea they said good by / and promised to see each other again / the end.
154,DE_SP_C2_24_11_13_LH,C2 (upper advanced),24,German,10,11.0,Once upon a time a little boy found a frog together with his dog he was very interested in it and watched it while while he placed it in a glass jar during the night the frog escaped and when the boy woke up in the morning together with his dog he was astonished to find that the frog had vanished and was very upset he began to search for the frog he went out to the forest and journeyed he climbed up onto a tree onto a boulder / and found himselfs in a tree / suddenly a deer appeared and he fell off a small (.) cliff he fell into the water into a small pond got out and when he / went over a fallen tree he actually found the frog and his family / he saw the frog took his into his hands and waved the frog family good-by saying good-by forever because he thought that he would be much happier with his family.
155,DE_SP_C2_24_14_14_YO,C2 (upper advanced),24,German,10,14.0,ok uh so uh it’s it’s a it’s a short film uh and there’s uh a a man with a hat on a construction site and at first uh he’s almost hit some some rubble uh and then discovers a baby uh lying on the ground uh ‘n’ he picks it up wonders what happened to the baby or why it is there and uh then he he sees a woman with a stroller uh and he he places the baby in in the stroller next to or opposite of the other baby uh and the woman gets gets mad because obviously it’s not her own baby uh she gets angry at him and then the man / uh yeah the man takes the baby back out of the stroller and wants it wants to place it back on the ground where he found it uh but then is interrupted by uh by a police officer uh / yeah so so the man picks the baby up instead and uh / yeah he walks a little with the baby and then uh he sees another an old man with a walking walking cane and uh he he tricks the the old man into holding the baby for him while uh the the first man uh pretends to tie his shoes uh then he quickly runs way and uh the next minute the old man uh yeah he he tries to / tries to find a place uh where he or tries to find out what to do with the baby hhh and then he sees the same stroller that the woman was pushing before uh he also places the baby in in the stroller uh walks away and then the first man uh walks by the stroller uh by accident uh and in that exact moment the the woman comes out discovers the baby and discovers the first man uh and uh / she I think she punches him or he she hits hits him with he= with her with her umbrella ‘n’ makes him uh pick up the baby again uh xxx the police officer was there too uh and / then I have to think for a moment / uh I think / I think then the uh xxx the first man goes back to the or goes to the street and sits uh sits down on the on the uh / yeah on the on the pave pave no it’s not the pavement / yeah he sits down on the street ‘n’ looks at the gutter uh and I think for a moment he wonders whether he could place the baby into the gutter uh but then he uh looks into the the blankets that the baby is wrapped in discovers a a written a handwritten note uh which says something along the lines of please take care of this orphan child uh ‘n’ that’s when the the man starts to grow fond of of the baby and / uh yeah and I think that’s when he decides not to / uh yeah get get rid of it anymore yeah and walks away
156,DE_SP_C2_24_16_14_SM,C2 (upper advanced),24,German,8,16.0,ok so it starts when Charles Chaplin walks through a town and he gets hit by someone probably throwing thrash out of the window uh when he stops to light a cigarette and when he tries to continue walking he sees a baby lying on the ground in the corner so he looks up to see maybe where it came from or if he’s if the baby is gonna get hit by something as well and he picks up the baby and continues walking with it but he doesn’t seem to want it so he looks for somewhere to drop it and that’s when he sees a mother carrying like a pram uh with another child in it so when the mother doesn’t look he tries to put the baby he found into the pram but the mother obviously realises that it’s not her child so she uh makes him get it out again and he walks back to where he found the baby ‘n’ puts it back on the floor but then when he wants to walk away he runs into a probably a police officer and he makes him pick up the baby again so he picks it up again ‘n’ walks away again and that’s when he sees another man walking so he pretends that he needs to tie his shoes so he hands the other man the baby and runs away quickly ‘n’ the other man tries to follow him but Charles Chaplin hides somewhere so he the man doesn’t find him so then the man sees the same pram that Charles already put the baby in ‘n’ is still standing outside somewhere he puts it in there again and walks away so Charles thinks that he’s safe now ‘n’ gets out of his hiding place and walks past the same pram so the mother sees him again ‘n’ thinks that he tried to put the baby in it again so she starts hitting him with her um= umbrella and tells the police man what happened so Charles Chaplin has to get back the baby again and he walks back to where he came from ‘n’ already thinks about putting it into the gutter basically and that is when he sits down ‘n’ he doesn’t seem to know what he is doin so he looks at the baby ‘n’ then finds this little note that says please take care and love this orphan child and then he suddenly starts smiling ‘n’ taking care of the baby ‘n’ just walks away with it ‘n’ seems to keep it
157,DE_SP_C2_24_16_14_VS,C2 (upper advanced),24,German,8,16.0,uh we see Charlie Chaplin walking through the streets and people are throwing thrash out of the windows ‘n’ some thrash hits Charlie Chaplin and he gets annoyed ‘n’ starts lighting his cigarette and uh then he sees a baby lying in a corner and he picks up the baby ‘n’ looks around but he can’t see anyone uh around uh so then he starts searching for someone the baby might belong to and he sees a woman with a pram walking by and  then he while the woman goes inside a house he lays the baby in the pram and tries to walk away but the woman comes out again and she gets angry because she already has a baby ‘n’ she doesn’t want this baby ‘n’ it’s not her baby uh so she says uh that Chaplin should take the baby again and Chaplin starts wandering off and he wants to lay the baby back where he found it but while he does that a police officer uh walks by and he uh he says that Chaplin isn’t allowed to do that just dropping off the baby so Chaplin picks up the baby again and uh starts wandering around and then he sees an old man who can’t walk really well and he asks the old man to uh hold the baby so he can tie his shoes and the old man picks the baby uh and Chaplin acts as if he wants to tie his shoes but then he runs away ‘n’ the old man can’t run as fast so uh he / he finds the same pram again uh that Chaplin used earlier and the mother is inside that store again and the old man lays the baby in the pram and walks away and the mother comes out of the store ‘n’ sees the baby again and at the same time Chaplin runs across the pram so the mother uh runs after him ‘n’ beats him up and uh advises him to take the baby again so Chaplin takes the baby again and walks away ‘n’ then he sits down ‘n’ is really uh tired and doesn’t know what to do with the baby and even thinks about dropping it in the sewage hhh or anything uh yeah but then he starts looking in the cloth ‘n’ blankets the baby is wrapped in and he finds a note and the note says uh please take care please love ‘n’ take care of this orphan child ‘n’ now Chaplin really does look at the child ‘n’ starts smiling and cuddling the baby ‘n’ they wander off together

317,ES_SP_C1_19_14_13_MAMO,C1 (lower advanced),19,Spanish,5,14.0,uh it's about a boy / who who had a / a frog / in a box / bueno in a in a glass box / so one night he goes to sleep / and next morning he finds out / that is gone / so he decided to go / with his dog / into the forest to look for for him for the frog / uh he finds a a beehive / is a beehive / uh in the forest / and after that he / uh mistakes a a tree with a deer / and the thi= this deer push him to the river / uh in the river and in the river he finally finds the frog
318,ES_SP_C1_21_13_3_MSL,C1 (lower advanced),21,Spanish,8,13.0,hhh okay so the last film that I watched was called kill a Mockingbird hhh and uh / here we have like / two main characters who are brothers hhh uh / well / it i= they they are a sister and a brother uh / the girl is called Scout and the boy is called / Jem hhh and basically uh / they live in a town hhh / uh were / there is a lot of free xxx and / people xxx each other and all the stuff hhh so basically they're interested in hhh one of his hhh hhh / one of their neighbours who is called uh Boo Radly hhh because uh the town / the people from that town had spread some rumours about him being hhh a mean person hhh and all that so / they try / to / know more about him and to make him hhh go out of his house hhh uh because he doesn't / usually / go out very fr= hhh very fr= he doesn't go out vey frequently hhh so they're interested in him and / hhh that's one / part of the plot because we have like two / main plots we could say hhh so the other bit is the uh hhh there is like / well their fa= their father is hhh a lawyer so he's got a case to / hhh uh defend uh / hhh basically uh / and black person who was accused of rape hhh so uh / uh none of the citizens / or the / yeah the people from that town believe it hhh uh his innocence obviously because he's just black / even though he / actually he was innocent so hhh uh these children uh / basically go through the process of the hhh of yeah through they go through co= through court hhh and attend trial and go through the process of this trial and / experience it hhh and they notice how racist uh hhh the people from their town are hhh and hhh well that's / basically most of / the / plot hhh or the ar= yeah yeah the main / hhh uh / the main plot we cou= we could say / hhh and uh hhh well uh / hhh through this process or / through this trial / uh what we can notice is that at the beginning of the movie hhh this children / uh / hhh are quite innocent and believe in / hhh in good people and all that and think that the / people from their / hometown hhh are / good / people / hhh but a= after / realizing / that / they're / actually / really racist because of what they've hhh experienced through the trial and all that uh they change their mind so they kind of become more mature hhh and regarding Boo Radly who I mentioned before uh / they also come to understand that hhh he doesn't go out because he because he doesn't / like to hhh so / they basically stopped annoying him and hhh trying to uh make him go out of his ho= of his house hhh and actually in / in the end uh / hhh the person who accu= well / one of the / per= / one of the people who accused uh hhh that black person of the rape hhh / actually it was uh the father of the / hhh uh of the girl that he supposedly raped hhh so this man / uh tried to kill / the two children Scout and Jem hhh and / uh / hhh their neighbour / Boo Radly is the one who actually saved them / hhh so yeah that's another important thing about the movie hhh and / uh / well Scout / uh Gem gets / injured hhh but Scout doesn't / and / she meets / uh Boo Radly / at that pre= / at that precise moment because before / uh / hhh they have / none of them had met him so / uh she meet him / at that moment and realizes that hhh he's uh really nice nice person and / that / obviously he saved their lives so he cha= she she changed hhh her mind about / her / preconceptions or opinion about hhh this person / hhh and yeah she also becomes more mature because I haven't mentioned before but uh I haven't mentioned it before but hhh uh / this girl was / six years old and / her brother was / eleven / or ten / hhh don't remember / too well but / around that age hhh so they become a bit more mature hhh uh obviously Jem is now an adolescent / because in the course of the novel he turns / twelve or thirteen so we could say that / he's kind of adolescent hhh but / Scout is still a girl because she turns / nine I think in the course of the no= of the novel hhh but she becomes a bit more / realistic about life and all that so / hhh yeah that's basically the main thing about / hhh that / uh yeah I'm saying a novel sometimes because I forget because hhh I actually / read the book and also watched the movie so / I may have said novel instead of hhh film at some points but yeah I refer to the film hhh and yeah that's basically / about it you know the main things / to kind of highlight from this movie or novel because / yeah hhh uh you can find both formats hhh uh xxx / uh / the / yeah and precon= preconceptions about people / and / criticism and staff hhh and also yeah the the process of maturing of this two / children and realizing that / life is not as good as they had imagined / and yeah that's basically it
319,ES_SP_C1_23_10_14_PG,C1 (lower advanced),23,Spanish,8,10.0,so in the video Chaplin is walking through old buildings / when something falls on him uh and obviously he gets mad / after this he starts smoking a cigarette and while he's smoking he sees a baby lying on the floor / and apparently it's an abandoned baby / uh and seems very confused but he takes the baby / while he is holding the child uh he sees a woman with a baby trolley / so immediately Chaplin thinks that the baby belongs to this woman / and he goes towards her and when is leaving the baby in the baby trolley hhh uh the woman notices / and she gets mad 'cause it's not her baby / uh again well then Chaplin takes the baby with him and and he runs / and after this uh he goes back to the place where he found the baby hhh and he tries to leave the baby again on the floor but while he is doing it a policeman observes him hhh and he notices hhh so again he takes the baby with him and runs and there is a kind of chase between the policeman and Chaplin / hhh but while is Chaplin is running uh he sees a f= a a a or he finds an old man an unknown old man hhh and basically he gives the baby to this old man and runs / so this person gets confused and and start chasing Chaplin hhh and while he is uh / running he finds again the lady the lady that I've mentioned at the beginning of the story and and he observes that she she has a baby trolley / so this man leaves the baby in the baby trolley and then he escapes / hhh uh hhh well the woman didn't notice about this hhh and when she uh looks again to the baby trolley uh she sees that there is an unknown baby in in in the trolley / basically / uh and simultaneously she finds or she sees Chaplin running / so she thinks that again Chaplin uh was the one who had uh / left the baby there / so they start like arguing / Chaplin and this lady / and the woman punches him and / basically Chaplin has to leave with the baby again / and after this after the chase uh he is exhausted and he sits on the pavement / with the baby / while he is holding the baby / and he notices that in i= within the clothes of the baby there is a kind of note and then he takes the note and and he reads it / and it says something like it's an abandoned baby or is an orphan baby / so / Chaplin feels pity for for the child and / finally we don't know exactly if he adopts th= adopts the child or not but he takes with him / and that's it
320,ES_SP_C1_23_17_14_NBO,C1 (lower advanced),23,Spanish,6,17.0,uh so the video is a / short story that stars Chaplin / uh it begins with Chaplin uh walking down an alleyway / and uh then suddenly while he is walking someone throws garbage / and it falls on top of him / uh he then procceeds to uh pull out a can of used cigars / and lights one up / uh despite uh it been a bit broken / uh then he continues walking and finds a baby / just lying on the floor / in the alleyway / and he decides to pick it up and as he sees a woman walking with a stroller / he thinks it could be hers / so he puts the baby in the stroller / but the woman is mad / so we can assume that is not her baby / so he then picks the baby up again / and walks back to the place he found it / and tries to put it back on the floor / but he is seen by the police / so he decided= he decides to pick the baby up again / and leaves that alleyway / hhh uh he then finds an old man / and uh he decides to ask the old man to pick the baby while he is allegedly tying his shoes / uh and when the old man grabs the baby / he runs away and hides / the old man uh sees again the lady with the stroller / and puts the baby in / hhh and / uh that woman / sees Chaplin just walking uh normally / and because he / before tried to put the baby in / she gets mad at him again / uh and the police arrives / so Chaplin again has to take the baby / with him / he then arrives uh at a place with a sewer / and thinks about putting the baby in the sewer / but he feels guilty about it / so he sits with the baby / he then uh cuts his finger with a note that is inside / uh the baby's like clothes / and he reads it / and someone asks uh for him or for whoever finds the baby / to love it and take care of it / so Chaplin decides to uh hold the baby / and take care of it / and then he walks away
321,ES_SP_C1_24_16_14_DPD,C1 (lower advanced),24,Spanish,8,16.0,at the beginning we can see Charles Chaplin who is having a walk / and suddenly / after a few incidents / he realizes that there is a / newborn baby dropped in in the floor / so he decided to / pick him up / and / after seeing a woman / with a baggie with a pushed chair / having a different kid / it's probably that Charles Chaplin thought this found baby to be / uh the womans' baby / so uh he / uh took the decision to put this / found baby this abandoned baby / back in the in this womans' / baggie however when the woman realize that / Charles Chaplin had dropped off a baby which wasn't hers in her baggie / she told him off and made him to pick him uh pick this baby / up again / so  Charles Chaplin a bit / feeling a bit disoriented / uh tried to / abandon the baby again in the same place where he found it initially / but he uh he didn't do it finally because he found policeman so uh he's initial resolution changed / and he took again the baby / and walked walked around the place as if nothing had happened / while / trying to while trying to decide what to do finally with the kid / he sees an old man / and ask asked him asked him a favor to take the kid while he / was going to do something else like lacing up his shoes / so this old man decided to help him but Charles Chaplin uh what he really wanted to do was to flee and actually when he saw that the old man was going to help him by having the kid on his arms / uh he Charles Chaplin tried to flee away / but uh / well actually he he got to / to flee away / and the old man was still having the / this abandoned kid on his arms / and paradoxically he found again the same bag the same the same baggie sorry the same / uh the previous womans' baggie with the other baby the one that Charles Chaplin had found before and where he had put the baby just a minutes ago / some minutes ago so this old man decided again to put / the baby back on this baggie / and he left the place without being seen / so after this / after this uh Charles Chaplin walks around the street and the woman now notices that the same baby as before has being put again on her / pushed chair / so when she uh finds Charles Chaplin again she gives this baby this abandoned baby back to him / and she uh very angry angrily she leaves the place / meanwhile uh Charles Chaplin is walk= was walking / throughout the the street / finally / Chaplin sat down / in / in the pavement / and thinking about the possibility of / abandoning the child / he came across a a small note which was / uh hidden in the babys' / clothes which said / please love this abandoned baby / and at that moment we notice how / Charles Chaplin uh starts to sort of grow fond of this little kid
322,ES_SP_C1_19_13_14_IGT,C1 (lower advanced),19,Spanish,6,13.0,ok so Chaplin is walking down / kind of a sketchy alley / and then he lights up a cigar / and when he starts smoking and he sees a baby laying on the floor / no on the ground / and then he sees a lady with a stroller / and he thinks it's hers / so he puts it in / the stroller but then the lady says it's not hers and then she gives it back to him / so then Chaplin puts it back when he found him uh them / and but then a police officer sees him / and tells Chaplin to pick it up obviously / and so Chaplin then uh walks again down the street and then he sees a an old man with a walking stick / stick so uh he gives it to this old man / and then this old man sees / at the stoller of the lady before / and he puts it in the stroller / uh and then well and then he goes away / and then the lady sees uh Chaplin again passing by the stroller / so she thinks it was him who had put the baby in again / so she starts hitting him with the umbrella / and gives it back to him again / so he / uh he takes it  and Chaplin / uh takes the baby and then he sits / and then he sees kinda fun note / uh in the / clothing of the baby / and then he sa= he he sees a note / where it says uh / that he should take / care of the baby and love him / because it has uh no parents / and then he walks away with the baby / and that's it
