## Introduction

 This project was conducted as an analysis of morpheme acquisition order. Many 'natural order' studies proclaim that there is a consistent order in which language learners acquire proficiency in the use of grammatical morphemes. To understand this, it is important to make the distinction between lexical and grammatical morphemes. In the word *played*, there is a lexical morepheme (*play*) and a grammatical morpheme (*-ed*). The field of natural order studies, and this project, is primarily concerned with the latter type, which are also known as functors. The terms functor and morpheme are used interchangeably in this project. 
 
 Natural order studies originated in the 1970's when researchers were looking into the "independent grammars assumption," that is, the perspective that when children acquire their first language, they begin as speakers of their own personal languages rather than as defective speakers of the adult version of the language. The first of many studies of this kind was Brown's (1973) longitudinal study of three native American-English speaking children. Brown observed that children learn English morphemes in the same order, though not at the same age. The work of Brown (1973) and other first language researchers was extended to second language acquisition to demonstrate that SLA is not just a matter of learned responses but that competence is actually developed according to a predictable series of benchmarks. Various studies in SLA supported researchers' expectations that the order of morpheme acquisition is largely consistent across language learners, and also revealed that children and adult learners acquire morphemes in the same general order. Such studies have been largely influential in the field until the present day.

 Curious to see if proposed 'natural orders' of morpheme acquisition could be analyzed through corpora, I formulated this project. My questions are as follows: (1) Does the sequence of morpheme acquisition in the data align with previously proposed acquisition orders? and (2) How does acquisition potentially differ between first langauge (L1) and second langauge (L2) corpora? 

## Data
The data utilized in this project was mostly sourced from [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/). TalkBank is a multilingual database focused on research in the study of human communication. It provides repositories in 14 research areas, including child langauge acquisition ([CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org/)) and second language acquisition ([SLABank](https://slabank.talkbank.org/)). I used corpora from these two collections in order to conduct my analysis. 

The recording transcripts in TalkBank databases is tored in a dedicated format known as CHAT. I used a Python library, [PyLangAcq](https://pylangacq.org/), to import and parse the CHAT data files.
