## Summary

This project investigates the morpheme acquisition order of native English speakers and English language learners. Based on 'natural order studies,' which are influential in the fields of linguistics and second langauge acquisition, the project takes a data-science approach to analyzing the developmental patterns of grammatical morphemes in language acquisition. 

## Data

The data sources utilized in this project are sourced from [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/). I focused on two corpora:

1) [CHILDES Frogs English Slobin Corpus](https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Frogs/English-Slobin.html) (Native speakers)

2) [Vercellotti Corpus](https://slabank.talkbank.org/access/English/Vercellotti.html) (Language learners)
